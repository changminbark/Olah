# Olah: A social media platform for sports-lovers to meet up and exercise!
---

A full-stack responsive website project that uses MERN and revolves around a business idea of connecting sports-lovers to each other. It allows them to organize events and compete to rank up. This was inspired by [Ed Roh's tutorial on creating a MERN application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o&ab_channel=EdRoh).


This project was mainly to get me introduced to all aspects of web development using a MERN stack. There are a plethora of things I learned, such as API calls, middleware tokens, yup, and routes.

To run the website, I need to type nodemon or node index.js after cd to server dir, and npm start after cd to client dir in a different terminal.

Project was completed on July 18, 2023.
