This project was mainly to get me introduced to all aspects of web development using a MERN stack. There are a plethora of things I learned, such as API calls, middleware tokens, yup, and routes.

To run the website, I need to type nodemon or node index.js after cd to server dir, and npm start after cd to client dir in a different terminal.
